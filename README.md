# TravelTide_Project


Introduction

In today's competitive travel landscape, retaining loyal customers is paramount. To achieve this, we've embarked on a comprehensive project to optimize our loyalty program. By harnessing the power of data analytics, we've segmented our customer base into six distinct groups, each with unique preferences and behaviors. Our goal is clear: to design personalized perks that resonate deeply with each segment. By tailoring our offerings to individual needs, we aim to foster stronger customer relationships, drive repeat bookings, and elevate overall satisfaction. This report presents our findings and outlines actionable recommendations to achieve these objectives. Through data-driven insights, we've identified the key drivers of customer loyalty within each segment, enabling us to craft highly effective perks that will strengthen our bond with our valued customers.

Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated customer segmentation strategy that enhances our loyalty program by effectively identifying and targeting distinct types of travelers. By leveraging detailed customer data and advanced analytical techniques, we aim to segment our traveler base into well-defined groups, each with unique preferences and behaviors. Our goal is to tailor our perks to these specific segments to increase customer satisfaction, foster repeat bookings, and ultimately drive higher revenue through a more personalized and engaging loyalty program.

Methodology

This project involved applying machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to segment travelers based on their behaviors and preferences. We began by collecting and preparing data, including traveler behaviors and characteristics, followed by basic data cleaning and feature engineering to create metrics such as average spending per trip and booking frequency. Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover patterns, visualize data distributions, and understand correlations between key features. We used the K-Means algorithm to cluster travelers into distinct groups, with steps including feature selection, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and determining the optimal number of clusters. Each cluster was then profiled to understand its unique characteristics. Based on these profiles, we developed a strategy for personalized perk allocation tailored to each segment, followed by a comparison of different cluster configurations to refine recommendations. The final findings and recommendations were reported and presented to stakeholders to guide future marketing strategies.

This project is an individual project.
